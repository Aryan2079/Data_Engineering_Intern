# 🐍 Python Programming Concepts

## 1. What is OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing programs by organizing code into objects that represent real-world things or concepts by bundling data and behavior together.

### Pillars of OOP
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## 2. Differences between OOP and Procedural Programming

| Feature | OOP | Procedural Programming |
|------|-----|------------------------|
| Basic Concept | Focuses on objects and classes | Focuses on functions and procedures |
| Data Handling | Data and methods are bundled together | Data is usually separate from functions |
| Approach | Bottom-up approach (build objects first, then connect them) | Top-down approach (start with the main problem, then break into functions) |
| Reusability | High code reuse | Limited code reuse |
| Security | More secure | Less secure |
| Examples | Java, Python, C++, C# | C, Fortran |

## 3. Data Types and Data Structures in Python

### Data Types in Python
- int
- float
- complex
- bool
- str
- NoneType

### Data Structures in Python

#### Built-in Data Structures
- List
- Tuple
- Set
- Dictionary

#### User-defined Data Structures
- Class

## 4. Conditional Statements in Python

Conditional statements are control statements that allow a program to execute different blocks of code based on a condition.

### Main Conditional Statements
- if
- if ... else
- if ... elif ... else
- match ... case

---

## 5. Loops in Python

Loops are control statements that allow a block of code to run repeatedly until a specified condition is met.

### Types of Loops
- for loop
- while loop

## 6. Functions in Python and Why They Are Used

A function in Python is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task.  
Functions help organize programs into smaller, manageable parts.

### Syntax of a Function
```python
def function_name(parameters):
    # code to be executed
    return value
```

## 7. What are the differences between a class and an object?

| Class                           | Object                           |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| A blueprint or template         | An instance of a class           |
| Defines attributes and methods  | Represents a real, usable entity |
| Does not occupy memory for data | Occupies memory                  |
| Used to create objects          | Created using a class            |
| Logical concept                 | Physical / real-world entity     |
