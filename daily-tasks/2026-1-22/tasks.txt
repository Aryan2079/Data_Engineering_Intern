Day 2 Task:
Task 1: Create a class Book with attributes title and author. Then create two different objects from this class and print their details.

Task 2: Write a Laptop class with attributes brand and price. Create 3 objects and store them in a list. Print the list in a readable way (e.g., Dell - $800).

Task 3: Create an abstract base class Employee (use ABC) with:
Abstract method calculate_salary()
Abstract method get_role()
Concrete method display_info() that uses the abstract methods
Class variable company_name
Create inheritance hierarchy:
Employee
├── FullTimeEmployee (has annual_salary, benefits)
│   └── Manager (has team_size, bonus_percentage)
│       └── Director (has department, additional_stock_options)
└── ContractEmployee (has hourly_rate, hours_worked, contract_duration)

Each subclass must:
Implement all abstract methods differently
Override work() method with specific behavior
Call parent's init using super()
Add at least one unique method
Demonstrate:
Polymorphism: store different employee types in a list and call methods
Method resolution order (MRO) by printing it
Creating instances of all concrete classes (not abstract Employee)
Show how each calculates salary differently


Task 4: Implement a class BankAccount that:
        
Uses encapsulation for balance (private variable).
Provides public methods deposit, withdraw, and get_balance.
Add docstrings to simulate abstraction.

Task 5: Write a class DataSize with init, str, and add so you can add two DataSize objects and print them nicely.

Task 6: Implement a class Team with len so that len(team) returns the number of players.

Task 7: Create a class Dog with a class variable species = "Canine". Each object should also have its own name. Demonstrate the difference by printing both.

Task 8: Extend the Dog class with a counter (class variable) that tracks how many dogs have been created so far.

Task 9: Create a class MathOps with:
        
an instance method square(self, x)
a classmethod cube(cls, x)
a staticmethod is_even(x)

Task 10: 
 Create an Employee class with class variable company = "GrowByData"
Implement a classmethod to change company name with validation:
   
Must be 3-50 characters
Must contain only letters, numbers, and spaces
Add instance attributes: name, email, employee_id, salary, department
Implement a classmethod to generate unique employee IDs (format: EMP-YYYY-XXXX)
Add a class variable to track all employees and department counts
